When would you  want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
-- When it is more convenient.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

-- There may be other deveolpers adding their work to the remote repository
which may conflict with your own work... So you wouldnt want an 
automated update to modify files you were working on.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

-- forks are clones on GitHub, with the ownership changed to your account.
   clones are copies of a repository, either yours are someone elses without
   a change in ownership
   branches are splits within the repository 
   Use fork to make your own copy of someone elses repository
   Use clone to make a copy, and use branch to split the code in a repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

-- less likely to have conflicts that need to be manually merged. 

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

-- You could collaborate verbally (in person, or over the phone), via snail mail or email, or by some unknown, future communication method. Hardest = snail mail. Easiest = verbally, in person. 

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
